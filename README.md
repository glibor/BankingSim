# BankingSim

BankingSim is a model developed to simulate the banking sector and analyze the impacts of different policies on the system. Based on the work present in Barroso et al., (2016) and Ad√£o et al. (2022). 

The model simulates both the real sector and the interbank credit markets, producing results under different policy settings.
